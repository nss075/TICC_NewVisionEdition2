# TICC_NewVisionEdition2
On the occasion of World Mental Health Day, October 10, 2023, we kindly request that
you take a moment to pause from your hectic schedule and prioritize your mental wellbeing. This year's theme for World Mental Health Day is "Mental health is a universal
human right," and in celebration of the importance of mental health and counselling, we
are delighted to launch the second edition of our e-magazine, "NEW VISION." This
magazine has been carefully curated to introduce you to various aspects of mental
wellness. Inside, you will find a range of content that offers a unique and enriching
perspective on addressing the most common mental health issues. Whether you prefer
reading opinion pieces, delving into insightful stories of resilience and determination in
the face of mental health challenges, or seeking ways to improve your quality of life
through articles by Thapar Institute Counselling Cellâ€™s Mental Health Student
Ambassadors, this magazine has something to offer everyone.
